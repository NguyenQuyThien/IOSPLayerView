## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Clone this repo and copy my AVPlayerView.swift into your project!

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
With code programmatically:

```
let videoView = AVPlayerView()
let heightConstant: CGFloat = UIScreen.main.bounds.width * 9 / 16
// and use autolayout to this view (detail in demo example).
...
layer.frame = videoView.bounds
videoView.layer.insertSublayer(layer, at: 0)
videoView.playerLayer = layer
```

Or in storyboard (drag out a UIView in your storyboard and choose Custom Class > Class is AVPlayerView):

![Usage in storyboard](https://github.com/NguyenQuyThien/IOSPLayerView/blob/master/demo%20and%20screenshot/usage%20in%20storyboard.png)

Note: you should have a PlayerManager class. 
      And you have to check the slider is being touched befor update slider with KVO.

```
guard videoView.slider.isTracking == false else { return }
```
